# Gigavibe - Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 1, 2024
Effective: May 1, 2024

Welcome to Gigavibe! This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Gigavibe, a Discord bot created by me, the GitHub Repository owner, ZeNyfh.<br>
By using Gigavibe, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information Collected

- When I say "Gigavibe" or "the project" in this privacy policy, I am referring to the bot designed to play music from various streaming services and audio files provided by users via HTTP/S URLs, and this GitHub repository.
- When I say "project owner", "ZeNyfh", or "I" in this privacy policy, I mean myself, the owner of this GitHub repository, ZeNyfh.
- When I say "users", "moderators", "administrators", "owner" in this privacy policy, I am referring to the users of the Discord service.
- When I say "bug command", "DJ command", "help command", "dj add", "dj remove" in this privacy policy, I am referring to a feature that can be used by users.
- When I say "guild" in this privacy policy, I am specifically referring to a Discord guild, commonly known as a Discord server, which has Gigavibe present within it.

### 1.1 User-Provided Information
- Gigavibe does not directly collect any personal information from users. It operates solely within Discord guilds and utilises Discord-provided data for functionality.

### 1.2 Server Data
- Gigavibe processes and stores information related to guilds, including server IDs, Role IDs, and User IDs. This data is used solely for the operation of Gigavibe within the Discord environment.<br>
For more context, Role IDs and User IDs are only stored when the user adds them manually, such as when [Providing Specific Commands or Actions](https://github.com/ZeNyfh/gigavibe-java-edition/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md#L32
). Any data that is stored can be removed manually at any time by the user as well.


## 2. Use of Information

Gigavibe uses collected data within relevant guilds for the following purposes:
- To provide users, which have the MESSAGE_MANAGE permission, with a good way to moderate use of Gigavibe by other users.
- To comply with legal requirements, if necessary.

### 2.1 Providing Specific Commands or Actions
- When a user provides input into a command, no message data is stored unless specified by the user.<br>
a user specifies when user IDs, Role IDs, and Guild IDs are stored only within the DJ command. This is done by using "dj add <user/role>" and any values inside can be viewed by using "dj list" and also be removed at any time by using "dj remove <user/role>"

## 3. Data Security

Gigavibe takes reasonable measures to protect data against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 4. Data Sharing

Gigavibe does not share user data with third parties. Data is only processed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 5. Changes to the Privacy Policy

- Gigavibe's Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Users will be notified of any significant changes through the Discord server or via the Github before or at the time the changes take effect.

## 6. Contact Information

- For any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact @zenyfh on Discord via direct message, via the bug command, or through Github Issues.

Thank you for using Gigavibe!
