- Moderators, administrators, the owner of the guild, or more specifically users that can manage messages/have the MESSAGE_MANAGE permission in the guild, are responsible for controlling DJ permissions to moderate other users.<br>I am not liable for this in any way as the necessary tools are provided.

## 6. Termination and Discontinuation
- I may terminate user access if hosting becomes unfeasible. Users will be provided with notice or relevant information in such circumstances.

- Support is available through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZeNyfh/gigavibe-java-edition), the bug command, the [support server](https://discord.com/invite/gYXetvxawe), and contributions from the community.

## 10. Updates and Notification
- Users will be notified of changes to the Terms of Service through the Discord server and GitHub repository. Continued use implies acceptance.

## 11. Dispute Resolution
